user_description: A very passionate, detail-oriented and organized leader and team player with extensive research, wet lab, dry lab, data analysis, data science and chemistry / biology experience. I have a B.S. degree in Human Dietetics, a M.S. in Food Science Technology and Engineering, and currently in my 4th year of my Ph.D. program in Biology. My Ph.D. research is highly intersectional between Industrial Engineering and Biology, with a focus on microbiome analysis, bioinformatics and Internet of Things (IoT). My M.S. work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture under the SAFE grant, and my Ph.D. work is being supported by the National Institutes of Health under the RISE grant.<br><br>In my current role, I conduct on-site research, wet lab experiments, and bioinformatics analysis through R, Python, Bash and SQL. The main focus of my Ph.D. is to develop a healthy microbiome for the host through feed ingredient modifications. As a result, this will help the aquaculture industry reduce feed costs by ~90%. An extension of my main focus, is to establish a protocol to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein into arthropod ovaries by the use of Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo technology. My secondary focus is to develop a cloud based data collection system which gathers different environmental parameters, and automatically modifies them in a closed system based on machine learning predictions. I work in an Immunology lab where we work with different cell types and proteins that dictate different immune resistances when the model host undergoes Schistosoma infection.<br><br>My skills and experience as a researcher, biologist, educator, data analyst, data scientist, biostatistician, bioinformatician, make me well-suited to work across various sectors and spaces.Outside of professionalism, I spend most of my weekends walking my puppy, hiking, biking, working out, reading, trying out at a new restaurant, taking a random class on a random topic, enjoying a good Harry Potter marathon, watching Dune for the 100th time or playing video games.<br><br>Just a simple guy, with a scientific mind.
