username: Jorge Galarza Prieto, Ph.D.
user_description: A very detail-oriented and organized team player with extensive research, wet lab, dry lab, molecular biology, microbiology, and bioinformatics experience. I have a B.S. degree in Human Dietetics, a M.S. in Food Science Technology and Engineering, and lastly a Ph.D. in Biology. My M.S. work was fully funded by the United States Department of Agriculture under the Southwest Agriculture and Food Security Education (SAFE) grant (Award#2014-38422-22084), and my Ph.D. work was fully funded by the National Institutes of Health under the Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) grant (Award#R25GM061222).<br><br>In my current role, I conduct on-site research, wet lab experiments, and bioinformatics analysis through R, Python, Bash and SQL. The main focus of my Ph.D. is to develop a healthy microbiome for the host through feed ingredient modifications. As a result, this will help the aquaculture industry reduce feed costs by ~90%. An extension of my main focus, is to establish a protocol to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoprotein into arthropod ovaries by the use of Receptor-Mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo technology. My secondary focus is to develop a cloud based data collection system which gathers different environmental parameters, and automatically modifies them in a closed system based on machine learning predictions. I work in an Immunology lab where we work with different cell types and proteins that dictate different immune resistances when the model host undergoes Schistosoma infection.<br><br>My skills and experience as a researcher, biologist, educator, data analyst, data scientist, biostatistician, bioinformatician, make me well-suited to work across various sectors and spaces.<br><br>Outside of professionalism, I spend most of my weekends walking my puppy, hiking, biking, working out, reading, trying out at a new restaurant, taking a random class on a random topic, enjoying a good Harry Potter marathon, watching Dune for the 100th time or playing video games.<br><br>Just a simple guy, with a scientific mind.
